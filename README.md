# PD-latent-jamming
“Latent Jamming” is a combination of techniques and practices of real time intervention in the latent space of [nn~](https://github.com/acids-ircam/nn_tilde) compatible neural audio models (e.g. [RAVE](https://github.com/acids-ircam/RAVE), [VSCHAOS2](https://github.com/acids-ircam/vschaos2), [MSPrior](https://github.com/caillonantoine/msprior) or [AFTER](https://github.com/acids-ircam/AFTER). \
This repository contains abstractions written in Pure Data that mimick latent embeddings and can be used for audio generation together with the decoder of aforementioned model architectures. \
